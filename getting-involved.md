The copyright for the code is held by the individual contributors of the code under the terms of KLEE's license.

## Bug Reports

If you find a bug in KLEE, please fill a bug report on [GitHub](https://github.com/klee/klee/issues/new). You might also want to report it on [klee-dev]({{site.baseurl}}/klee-dev).

## Working with the Code

You should first check [KLEE's developer's guide]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/developers-guide).

Developer documentation is written in [Doxygen]({{site.baseurl}}/doxygen/html/).

Many parts of KLEE rely on the LLVM infrastructure, so you might also want to look at [LLVM's General Programming
Documentation](http://llvm.org/docs/#llvmprog).
